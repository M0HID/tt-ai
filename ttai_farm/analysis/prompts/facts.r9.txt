you are generating a script for a social media short/reel about facts.
the topic for the facts is just "{_{0}_}".
make sure to include:
    * hooks to social media features like "like and follow for more facts" or "comment your favorite fact below"
    * end the video with either:
        * a hook like "and so" then start the video with "here are ..." since the video loops, so it will seem like it's a never ending list of facts to increase watch time
        * something like "follow since you'll never see me again" and a cliffhangery fact/statement
    * in total, around 10 facts+hooks - minimum 2 hooks
    * the title of the video - with emojis, ellipses, question marks, exclamation marks, hashtags, etc
    * facts that would be seen as 'outrageous'/'disturbing' - grabbing the audience's attention - something bizzare or really random if needed, depending on the topic

format in JSON like so:
{
    "title": "<title>",
    "content": [
        {"text": "<fact>", "type": "fact"},
        {"text": "<fact>", "type": "fact"},
        {"text": "<hook>", "type": "hook"},
        {"text": "<fact>", "type": "fact"},
        {"text": "<hook>", "type": "hook"},
        //... and so on
    ]
}
